###<p style="color:#7A7676">Summary</p> 
My name is Chen Yong, I graduated from JiangSu University of science and technology and major is computer science.
I joined in FNST in 2012 and worked on `C`/`python` involved projects(engine electronic control system) for Japanese customers. However, after half of a year , I started to be a java web developer and worked so far. I became an experienced web system developer with backend knowledge including `servlet`,`SSH framework`and`MySQL`.I am also familiar with some frontend technologies including `javascript`/`jQuery`/`AngularJs` and `html`. 

I'm enthusiastic about open source projects and love to learn new knowledges. In my spare time ,I learned `ruby`,and practise to use `Linux`,`vim` and `markdown` , try to work on `GitHub`, ask and answer questions at `Stack Overflow`. I am striving to become a full stack developer.
